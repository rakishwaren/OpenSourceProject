This project provides an example for getting the HTML of the selected text in a Google Chrome extension.  There are two parts to the code: a content script and a background page.  The background page is unable to access the properties of the tab, so it must ask the content script to access it.  

From here, you can add on to the background.html page to do whatever you want with the text. I created a web service that will email the selected html to myself for reference.
